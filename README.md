Way Cooler is a customizable tiling window manager written in [Rust][] for [Wayland][wayland] and configurable using [Lua][].

It is heavily inspired by the tiling and extensibility of both [i3][] and [awesome][].

While Lua is used for the configuration, like awesome, extensions for Way Cooler are implemented as totally separate client programs using [D-Bus][].

This means that you can use virtually any language to extend the window manager, with much better guarantees about interoperability between extensions.

# Development

Way Cooler is currently in alpha. The core features have been added and it is in a usable state, but more work is needed to
make it user friendly. Here's an example of what Way Cooler looks like today:

## Motivation

We wanted to get experience with Rust and we found current X11 window managers to not have all the features we wanted.

Currently there are very few fully-featured tiling window managers in the Wayland ecosystem, as most of the effort has been porting Gnome and KDE over. Although Wayland is still in early-stage development
and is not backwards compatible with existing X11 tools, we wanted to put our stake in and provide for current tiling window manager users in the future.


## Current Features
- i3-style tiling
  * Horizontal/Vertical layouts
  * Tabbed/Stacked layouts
  * Nest containers with different layouts
  * Floating windows per workspace
- Client application support via the D-Bus IPC
  * See an example application [here](https://github.com/way-cooler/Way-Cooler-Example-Clients). It displays the tree in a somewhat organized format, and is actually really helpful for both debugging the tree and understanding how subcontainers work.
  * Enables dynamic configuration at runtime, without having to reload a configuration file
  * Allows extensions of the window manager to exist as separate programs talking over the IPC
- A Lua environment designed to make extending Way Cooler simple and easy
  * Lua is the configuration format, allowing the user to enhance their window manager in any way they want.
  * Utilities library included to aid communicating with Way Cooler
- X programs supported through XWayland
- Borders around containers
- Gaps between containers
- Basic X11 bar support (e.g [lemonbar][], [polybar][])
- Screen grabber / screen shot taker
- Lock screen

## Planned Features

- Notification support
- Tiling window through configurable Lua scripts (awesome-style)
- Swappable status bars/docs/menus
  * A status bar built with [Conrod](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod) and [Lua][]
- More customization settings

# Installation

## On the AUR

@vinipsmaker was kind enough to provide AUR packages:

[way-cooler][way-cooler-aur]

[way-cooler-git][way-cooler-git-aur]

## NixOS

@miltador was kind enough to provide a [NixOS package](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/window-managers/way-cooler/default.nix).

## openSUSE

@jubalh was kind enough to provide an [openSUSE package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/X11:windowmanagers/way-cooler).
Install with:

```
zypper ar -f obs://X11:windowmanagers windowmanagers
zypper in way-cooler
```

## Installation Script

For users who are not using the above mentioned Linux distributions, we have provided a simple install script that you can run in the terminal in order to install Way Cooler.

Please go to the [download page on our site](http://way-cooler.org/download) in order to dwnload Way Cooler.

## Build from source

You will need the following dependencies installed on your machine to install Way Cooler:
- Wayland
  * Including the server and client libraries
- wlc
  * Installation instructions can be found on [their github page](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc)
- Weston (optional)
  * The init file defaults to using `weston-terminal` as the default terminal emulator
- Cargo
  * The package manager / build system used by Rust
- Cairo

Finally, to install Way Cooler simply run the following cargo command:

```shell
cargo install way-cooler
```

You can try it out while running in an X environment, or switch to a TTY and run it as a standalone

# Init File

All keyboard shortcuts are configurable through the init file. The recommended strategy is to copy the [default configuration file](https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/blob/master/config/init.lua) to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/way-cooler/init.lua` and edit from there.

# Contributors
Way Cooler was started by @Timidger and @SnirkImmington, but these fine people have helped us:

- @vinipsmaker created (and maintains) AUR packages
- @miltador created NixOS package
- @starfys created way-cooler desktop file
- @toogley fixed a link
- @paulmenzel fixed a typo
- @thefarwind made kill way-cooler command rebindable
- @bluss for updating our use of `PetGraph` to use `StableGraph`
- @Abdillah
  + fixed background program to have solid colors be variable size at initilization
  + [added modes to the background program (fill, fit, stretch, title)](https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler-bg/pull/6#pullrequestreview-32859779)
- @hedning fixed an unsigned underflow in the tiling code
- @jubalh created the openSUSE package

And of course, thanks to the Rust community and the developers of [wlc].
