## Documentation
* Our current API documentation makes sense to us, but that's only because we've been staring at it for months. Any improvements or questions about what a function or module does is greatly appreciated.

## Client Programs
* We always need awesome client programs that work well with Way Cooler. Maybe you need something that spawns a notification when someone tweets at you. Or perhaps you want to open your music app whenever it detects your editor is open. Check out the [client libs](https://github.com/Immington-Industries/way-cooler-client-libs) and our [example clients](https://github.com/Immington-Industries/Way-Cooler-Example-Clients) for more information.
* More language wrappers around our IPC communication would help you or someone else make a great app that interfaces with Way Cooler. See the `docs/` for more information on the protocol.
* We expose a lot of information through the IPC. If you need something else exposed for an app, open an issue! On the other hand, if you think there might be a issue, such as with security, or the data we expose, please open an issue for that or contact us directly.

## Way Cooler
* There are a lot of small things that always needed to be done around Way Cooler. Sometimes it's a little clean up of technical debt, perhaps a bug fix or two, or some of the groundwork for a new feature. Ping Timidger or Snirkimmington on [gitter](https://gitter.im/Immington-Industries/way-cooler?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) to see how you can help out, or feel free to comment in any issue that you think you can help out in.
* One of the things we really need help on right now is our client bar. There's still a lot to discuss about how it will be designed and the kinds of things users can do with it. Come join the discussion [on gitter](https://gitter.im/Immington-Industries/way-cooler?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge).
* Our tiling system is pretty good, but it's still missing a few features. One of the major things we need to add are status bars (server-side decorations) around all the windows. That's a big blocker for a whole heap of features. We'd also like to hear how people use their tiling window managers right now to tile their setup, to see if we could support your workflow.
